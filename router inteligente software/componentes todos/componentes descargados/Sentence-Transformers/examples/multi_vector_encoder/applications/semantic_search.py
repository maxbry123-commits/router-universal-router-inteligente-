"""Semantic search over a small corpus with a multi-vector (ColBERT-style) model alone.

The corpus is embedded once into per-token embeddings, and each query is then scored against every
document with exhaustive MaxSim: every query token is compared against every document token of every
document. This is simple and exact, but token embeddings are far larger than single vectors, so it
only suits small corpora (a few thousand documents). For larger corpora, retrieve candidates with a
fast bi-encoder and rerank only those with the multi-vector model (see retrieve_rerank.py), or use a
dedicated late-interaction index such as PLAID (available via PyLate).
