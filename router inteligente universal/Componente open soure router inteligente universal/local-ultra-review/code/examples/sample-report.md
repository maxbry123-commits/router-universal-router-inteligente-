## Important Findings

### Deleted user lookup now skips tenant scope

- Severity: `Important`
- Location: `src/users.ts:42`
- Category: `security`
- What breaks: A workspace admin can request a user id from another workspace and receive profile data because the new query filters only by id.
- Why this diff: introduced or worsened by this diff
- Evidence:
  - `src/users.ts:42`: The changed query uses id without workspaceId after the diff removed the scoped helper.
- Verification: Base used the scoped helper; head queries by id only. A cross-workspace request reaches the changed path.
- Provenance: introduced by the current diff when it replaced the scoped helper with a raw id lookup
- Best fix: Restore workspaceId scoping at the user lookup ownership boundary or call the scoped helper.
- Refactor: No broader refactor is needed if the scoped helper remains the single tenant-boundary API.
- Proof: Base-vs-head comparison shows the workspaceId predicate disappeared; a cross-workspace fixture should reproduce the leak.
- Risk: Without the scoped lookup, any route that accepts an arbitrary user id can expose cross-workspace profile data.
