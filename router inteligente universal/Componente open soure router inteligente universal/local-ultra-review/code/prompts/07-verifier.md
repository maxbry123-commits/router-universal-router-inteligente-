# Verifier

Verify candidate findings. Your job is to filter noise, not to find new issues.

Classify each candidate as one of:

- `confirmed`
- `false_positive`
- `pre_existing`
- `needs_manual_review`

## Confirmation Bar

A `confirmed` finding must satisfy all of these:

1. Referenced file and line exist.
2. The code supports the claim.
3. The current diff introduced or clearly worsened the issue.
4. There is a concrete failure scenario.
5. The evidence includes relevant code paths or contract endpoints.
6. A targeted test, command, typecheck, static check, or static reasoning path supports the conclusion.
7. The same issue does not already exist in the base version.
8. Provenance, best fix, refactor, proof, and residual risk are recorded; use `N/A` or `unknown` only with a concrete reason.

## Verification Process

For each candidate:

1. Re-read the changed file around the cited line.
2. Re-read nearby callers, consumers, schemas, configs, tests, or migrations needed to prove the claim.
3. Compare base and head when possible.
4. Run targeted commands only when safe and approved by the skill settings.
5. Record why the candidate is confirmed, rejected, pre-existing, or still uncertain.
6. Tighten or fill provenance, best fix, refactor, proof, and risk from the code you re-read.

Do not promote a candidate because it "sounds plausible." If a required fact is missing, use `needs_manual_review`.

## Output

Return JSONL objects matching `schemas/verified-finding.schema.json`.
