# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `firecrawl_agent` now exposes the optional `effort` (`low`, `medium`, `high`), `maxCredits`, and `strictConstrainToURLs` parameters that `POST /v2/agent` already accepts, and forwards them in the request body.
- `firecrawl_agent` can continue a thread: it accepts `threadId` and `mode` (`"extract"` or `"chat"`) and forwards them to `POST /v2/agent` through the SDK. On a follow-up, omitted `mode`, `urls` and `schema` carry over from the previous turn. `firecrawl_agent_status` now keeps `message` and `suggestions` in its structured content, next to `threadId` and `threadTurn`.
- `firecrawl_agent` accepts an `exchange` object that mirrors the API's (`enabled`, `toolkits` (at most 5), `maxCalls`, `requireApproval`, `approve: { approvalId, callIds?, always? }`, `decline: { approvalId }`, `onTermsRequired`) and forwards it to `POST /v2/agent` through the SDK. `exchange.onTermsRequired` (`"skip"` or `"ask"`) controls Alexandria providers whose data terms the team has not accepted; they are never called. After an ask-mode terms offer and the user's explicit consent to `terms/accept`, a caller answers the offer on the same thread with `exchange.approve: { approvalId }` (or `exchange.decline`) instead of starting over. `approve` and `decline` require `threadId` and cannot be sent together, and `exchange.requireApproval` requires `mode: "chat"` on the same call. There is no auto-accept. `firecrawl_agent_status` now keeps `exchange` (including `skippedProviders` and `requiresAction`, whose provider `digest` is `string | null` and always present) and `pendingApproval` in its structured content.

### Changed

- `tools/list` now sends each tool's top-level `title` (MCP 2025-06-18), copied from `annotations.title`. The title wording is unchanged. Clients that read only the top-level field, such as Codex's tool search, now see the same display names.
- The npm package now bundles the pnpm-patched fastmcp. npm does not apply pnpm patches, so `npx firecrawl-mcp` installs were loading unpatched fastmcp from the registry, without the top-level titles or the `canList` and `beforeValidate` hooks. fastmcp's runtime imports (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `fuse.js`, `hono`, `mcp-proxy`, `undici`, `uri-templates`, `xsschema`) are now direct dependencies so they resolve under pnpm's non-hoisted layout too.
- Keyless recovery messages now link to the caller's own signup link, `https://firecrawl.dev/k/<token>` (a 12-character encrypted token), instead of `/app/api-keys`. The API issues the link (the `signup_url` of a keyless 429, or `signupUrl` from the eligibility check, which the server now also asks for when a keyless session calls an account-only tool) and the site decrypts it to MCP keyless attribution. When the API can't give one it sends the regular keyless signup link, which is relayed as is; with no API link at all the message uses the regular MCP signup link (`signin?utm_source=keyless&utm_medium=mcp`). Recovery payloads carry the link as `signup_url`. Signed-in users who open it land on the API keys page.
- The search surface (`/v2/mcp-search`) now exposes `firecrawl_find_tools` and `firecrawl_scrape` alongside its six search tools, so agents can execute the Alexandria providers that `firecrawl_search` already returns. Both carry surface-scoped descriptions that name only tools registered on that surface, and Alexandria results there omit the `firecrawl_feedback` pointer. See docs/search-profile.md.

### Fixed

- Hosted OAuth reuses a token's introspection answer for up to 60 seconds, capped by the token's expiry, and 10 seconds for an inactive answer. Concurrent requests with one token share a single introspection call, and failed introspections are never cached. This keeps each node under the issuer's per-IP rate limit, which was turning bursts into `Firecrawl credential validation is temporarily unavailable`. A revoked token can keep working for up to 60 seconds on a pod that cached it. Set `FIRECRAWL_OAUTH_INTROSPECT_CACHE_TTL_MS=0` to turn the cache off. `[MCP_CREDENTIAL_VALIDATION]` records now include `edge_mitigation` (`deny`, `challenge`, `rate_limit` or `other`) when the edge firewall blocked the introspection.
- `firecrawl_search` on both surfaces now forwards `includeDomains` and `excludeDomains` to `/v2/search` as body fields instead of rewriting the query with `site:` operators, so the API's domain enforcement applies to MCP callers.

## [3.25.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Alexandria discovery through `firecrawl_search` with `sources: ["alexandria"]` or `sources: [{ "type": "alexandria" }]`. Both profiles normalize the legacy `exchange` source to `alexandria` and return compact tool suggestions by default in `data.tools` with `creditsUsed` preserved.
- `firecrawl_find_tools` on the full surface provides category browsing, compact provider tools, selected full contracts, URL lookup and `nextTool` navigation.
- `firecrawl_scrape` executes one or up to ten calls using `alexandria: [{ provider, capability, options }]` instead of `url`. Results are returned as `{ success, scrape_id, requestId, data: { alexandria, creditsCost } }`. Errors preserve their code and available charge ID. Keyless sessions receive `Alexandria requires an API key on a team with Alexandria access`.
- Provider terms are read and accepted through nested `firecrawl_scrape` capabilities after a blocked request. Acceptance requires the reviewed version and digest, explicit user authorization and `confirmed: true`.
- Successful large Alexandria results use a retained-result handoff above 20,000 estimated tokens when remote access is verified.

## [3.21.4] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- `firecrawl_parse` now works on the remote hosted MCP server (`CLOUD_SERVICE`), not just local mode. Because the hosted server cannot read the caller's filesystem, hosted parse uses a two-call flow: the first call (`filePath`) returns a short-lived signed upload command plus a `nextToolCall` carrying an `uploadRef`; after the bytes are uploaded, the second call (`uploadRef`) parses the file server-side. The generated upload command never includes your Firecrawl API key, and the flow also works on the keyless remote URL.

## [3.20.2] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Added `redactPII` to scrape, parse, and nested scrape option schemas so MCP callers can request PII redaction with a single flag.

## [3.20.1] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Fix stdio transport regression introduced in 3.18.0 where every tool call
  failed with `Unauthorized: API key is required when not using a self-hosted
  instance` even when `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` was set. The OAuth refactor in 3.18.0
  made the `authenticate` callback unconditionally read `request.headers`, but
  `firecrawl-fastmcp` invokes `authenticate(undefined)` for stdio (there is no
  HTTP request context). The resulting `TypeError` was swallowed by FastMCP,
  leaving the session unauthenticated. Added a null guard so env-var
  credentials (`FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` / `FIRECRAWL_OAUTH_TOKEN`) are honored on
  stdio again.

## [3.19.1] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Refined monitor goal guidance for meaningful-change monitoring.
- Documented `isMeaningful`, `judgment`, and `meaningfulChanges` monitor results.

### Added

- Added a simplified `firecrawl_monitor_create` path using `page` or `pages` plus `goal`.
- Added monitor check status filtering to `firecrawl_monitor_checks`.

### Changed

- Updated monitor tool guidance to prefer goal-based meaningful-change monitoring and document `judgment` results.
