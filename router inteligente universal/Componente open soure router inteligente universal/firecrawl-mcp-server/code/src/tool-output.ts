/**
 * Declared tool output: schemas plus the helpers that attach structured
 * content to a result.
 *
 * Every registered tool declares an `outputSchema` so a client — and the model
 * behind it — knows the shape of a result before it calls the tool. MCP asks a
 * tool that declares one to return `structuredContent` next to the text block,
 * so the helpers here attach the structured payload without touching the text
 * a tool already returned: existing clients keep reading the exact same string.
 *
 * Two fastmcp behaviours shape the schemas below.
 *
 * 1. fastmcp advertises an output schema through `strictJsonSchema`, which
 *    sets `additionalProperties: false` on every object it emits. A schema
 *    therefore has to name each top-level key the tool can return.
 * 2. fastmcp validates `structuredContent` against the schema and keeps the
 *    parsed value, so a key the schema does not name is dropped from the
 *    structured payload. The text block still carries the whole response.
 *
 * So these schemas name the documented keys and leave the value of anything
 * that passes through from the Firecrawl API unconstrained (`z.unknown()`,
 * which advertises as `{}` and accepts any shape). Only fields whose scalar
 * type is part of the API contract are typed, and those are optional and
 * nullable through the `str`/`num`/`bool` helpers below: a value the schema
 * rejects would fail validation and turn a working call into an error.
