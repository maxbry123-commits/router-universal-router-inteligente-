# Firecrawl Skills

The full catalog of Firecrawl skills for AI coding agents, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format. Available as a plugin for Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenAI Codex.

> **This repository is a distribution catalog.** Every directory under `skills/` is a CI-synced mirror. Install skills from here; contribute skill changes at the source repository. Repository-level metadata is maintained here.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add firecrawl/skills
```

Without `-y` this opens an interactive picker over the whole catalog. Install a specific skill by name (names are path-independent):

```bash
npx skills add firecrawl/skills --skill firecrawl-build
```

For CLI onboarding (installs the Firecrawl CLI plus the core skills, with optional workflow skills):

```bash
npx -y firecrawl-cli@latest init
```

## Catalog layout

| Category | Path | What it's for | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core | [`skills/core/`](./skills/core) | The Firecrawl primitives for live web work during an agent session (search, scrape, crawl, interact — via the CLI or MCP), plus the research paper index and developer index skills | [`firecrawl/cli`](https://github.com/firecrawl/cli/tree/main/skills) |
| Build | [`skills/build/`](./skills/build) | Integrating Firecrawl APIs into product code: SDKs, REST, endpoint selection, API keys | [`firecrawl/firecrawl`](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl/tree/main/skills) (`skills/`) |
| Workflows | [`skills/workflows/`](./skills/workflows) | End-to-end session recipes: lead gen, deep research, SEO audit, knowledge bases, and more | [`firecrawl/firecrawl-workflows`](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl-workflows) |

## Contributing: where does my PR go?

## Skills

### Core (`skills/core/`)

Skills that teach agents the [Firecrawl CLI](https://github.com/firecrawl/cli) for live web work — `firecrawl`, `firecrawl-scrape`, `firecrawl-search`, `firecrawl-crawl`, `firecrawl-map`, `firecrawl-interact`, `firecrawl-agent`, `firecrawl-monitor`, `firecrawl-parse`, `firecrawl-download` — plus the index skills backing the `firecrawl research` and `firecrawl developer` commands:

| Skill                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`firecrawl-research-index`](./skills/core/firecrawl-research-index)   | Find papers in the research paper index — biomedical and life-science literature (PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv) plus arXiv preprints |
| [`firecrawl-developer-index`](./skills/core/firecrawl-developer-index) | Answer developer questions from issues, pull requests, READMEs, and documentation pages                                          |

### Build (`skills/build/`)

| Skill                                                                     | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`firecrawl-build`](./skills/build/firecrawl-build)                       | Firecrawl application API umbrella skill                                |
| [`firecrawl-build-onboarding`](./skills/build/firecrawl-build-onboarding) | Get `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` into a project and choose the right SDK/docs    |
| [`firecrawl-build-scrape`](./skills/build/firecrawl-build-scrape)         | Integrate `/scrape` for single-page extraction                          |
| [`firecrawl-build-search`](./skills/build/firecrawl-build-search)         | Integrate `/search` for discovery-first workflows                       |
| [`firecrawl-build-interact`](./skills/build/firecrawl-build-interact)     | Integrate `/interact` for clicks, forms, and dynamic flows after scrape |

### Workflows (`skills/workflows/`)

End-to-end recipes such as [`firecrawl-lead-gen`](./skills/workflows/firecrawl-lead-gen), [`firecrawl-deep-research`](./skills/workflows/firecrawl-deep-research), [`firecrawl-seo-audit`](./skills/workflows/firecrawl-seo-audit), [`firecrawl-competitive-intel`](./skills/workflows/firecrawl-competitive-intel), and more — see [`skills/workflows/`](./skills/workflows) for the full set, and [`firecrawl-workflows`](./skills/workflows/firecrawl-workflows) for the umbrella skill and authoring guide.

## MCP Server

The plugin includes Firecrawl MCP configuration for the official [Firecrawl MCP server](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl-mcp-server), so editors that support bundled MCP metadata can wire Firecrawl tools with `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`.

## Plugins

This repo serves as a plugin for multiple platforms, bundling the core and build skills (workflows are session recipes, not editor-integration material):

- **Claude Code** - `.claude-plugin/`
- **Cursor** - `.cursor-plugin/`
- **OpenAI Codex** - `.codex-plugin/`

## Prerequisites

- A Firecrawl account or self-hosted Firecrawl deployment
- API key stored in `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` for cloud usage

Get your API key at [firecrawl.dev/app](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app). If you do not have one yet, [`firecrawl-build-onboarding`](./skills/build/firecrawl-build-onboarding) includes the browser authorization flow.

## Which skills do I need?

- **"Search/scrape the web for me right now, during this session"** → core skills (`skills/core/`)
- **"Query published research papers or developer docs indexes"** → index skills (`skills/core/`)
- **"Add Firecrawl to this codebase"** → build skills (`skills/build/`)
- **"Run an end-to-end task like lead gen or deep research"** → workflow skills (`skills/workflows/`)

Both usage paths follow Firecrawl's onboarding skill (same install, different use cases): [firecrawl.dev/agent-onboarding/SKILL.md](https://www.firecrawl.dev/agent-onboarding/SKILL.md).
