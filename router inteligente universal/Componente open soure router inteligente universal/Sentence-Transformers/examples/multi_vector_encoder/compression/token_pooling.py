"""Compress a multi-vector document index with :class:`HierarchicalTokenPooling`.

Multi-vector (ColBERT-style) retrieval stores one vector per token, so a corpus of N documents at
D tokens each costs ~N * D * dim floats. Ward-linkage hierarchical clustering on the per-token
cosine similarities reduces this by a chosen factor with minimal recall loss (see the PyLate /
colpali-engine papers on hierarchical token pooling).

This script shows the three ways to apply a pooling and prints both the token-count reduction and
the MaxSim scores against a sample query so you can see how much recall shifts.

1. Per-call at encode time: ``model.encode_document(..., token_pooling=pooling)``.
2. Standalone on already-encoded embeddings: ``pooling.pool(embeddings)``.
3. As a pipeline module (uncomment the block below to bake it into the model itself).
