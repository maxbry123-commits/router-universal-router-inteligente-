# @getdesign/cli

> Generate production-ready `design.md` specs from live websites in your terminal.

`@getdesign/cli` captures a rendered landing page, analyzes its visual system,
and writes a Cursor-ready `design.md` with colors, typography, layout,
components, motion, and implementation guidance.

## Usage

```bash
DAYTONA_API_KEY=... OPENAI_API_KEY=... bunx @getdesign/cli https://cursor.com
bunx @getdesign/cli https://linear.app --out design.md
bunx @getdesign/cli --url https://example.com --site-name Example --out ./designs
```

The binary runs on Bun. Install Bun first if `bunx` is not available:
<https://bun.sh/docs/installation>.

When `--out` is omitted, the CLI writes to a deterministic local run folder:
`./getdesign-runs/<slug>/design.md`. This keeps generated files out of the repo
root while avoiding confusion with the package name.

Options:

- `--url <url>` or positional `<url>`: source URL to analyze.
- `--site-name <name>`: override the detected site name.
- `--out <path>`: write markdown to a file or directory. File paths are written
  exactly; existing directories or paths ending in `/` receive `design.md`.
  Without `--out`, output is written to `./getdesign-runs/<slug>/design.md`.
- `--daytona-api-key <key>` / `DAYTONA_API_KEY`: Daytona key for this run.
- `--openai-api-key <key>` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI key for this run.
- `--text-only-fallback`: explicitly skip screenshots and produce labeled text-only output. OpenAI is still required; Daytona is optional in this mode.

Progress is streamed to stderr as concise phase updates (`crawl`, `capture`,
`visual`, `describe`, `extract`, `synthesize`, `render`) so stdout and generated
files stay clean.

For tests or embedding, import `runGetdesignCli` from `./runGetdesign.ts` and
pass `argv`, `env`, `cwd`, or `now` instead of relying on global `process`
defaults.

## Screenshot files

Visual output includes `design.images/hero.webp` and `design.images/full-page.webp`, referenced by relative paths in `design.md`. A custom name such as `brand.md` uses `brand.images/`. Keep the document and directory together when moving or sharing them. Capture failure stops the command; images are omitted only with `--text-only-fallback`.
