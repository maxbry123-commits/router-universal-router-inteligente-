# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once surfaces begin publishing.

Changes that affect the public surfaces (HTTP API, `@getdesign/sdk`, `@getdesign/cli`, `getdesign` agent skill) are tagged with the surface in brackets, e.g. `[sdk]`, `[api]`, `[cli]`, `[skill]`, `[web]`. Shared-package changes are tagged `[types]`, `[agent]`, `[tools]`, `[ui]`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **[web]** Visible homepage FAQ with matching structured data and SEO validation notes.
- **[dashboard]** Page titles and published-run social metadata, with private and unpublished runs excluded from metadata reads.
- **[dashboard]** Account stores encrypted per-user Daytona and OpenAI keys. Dashboard runs decrypt those keys on the server and no longer read `DAYTONA_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the process environment.
- **[dashboard]** API, CLI, SDK, Skills, Docs, and Support pages with marketing-style animated demos, copy-paste quickstarts, and links to `docs.getdesign.app`. Documents that v1 has no getdesign API key; full runs use BYOK Daytona/OpenAI credentials.
- **[content]** New `@getdesign/content` package for shared demo sites, surface metadata, docs URLs, and snippet builders (used by dashboard, web, and video).
- **[tools]** `@getdesign/tools` now ships concrete `crawler`, `extractors`, `render`, and `daytona` modules with deterministic URL/CSS resolution, token extraction, markdown rendering, and typed Daytona helpers.
- **[infra]** `infra/daytona/Dockerfile` and `infra/daytona/README.md` define the first in-repo Daytona snapshot for Chromium + computer-use flows.
- **[skill]** New fifth surface: portable `SKILL.md` at `skills/getdesign/` that reproduces the 9-section `design.md` contract using any coding agent's built-in tools (WebFetch, browser, file write). Installable via `npx skills add MohtashamMurshid/getdesign`.
- **[skill]** `skills/getdesign/TEMPLATE.md` — field-by-field schema for each of the 9 sections, with example tables and a truncated worked example.
- **[skill]** `skills/README.md` — overview, install commands, and link to the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) leaderboard.
- **[web]** Landing page now advertises five surfaces: hero dots `Web · API · CLI · SDK · Skill`, the Surfaces section grid expanded from 4 to 5 cards, and the interactive demo gained a `skill` tab showing `npx skills add`, agent trace (`WebFetch`, `browser.screenshot`, `Write`), and the resulting `design.md`.
- **[repo]** `LICENSE` (MIT), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and a GitHub issue + PR template set under `.github/`.
- **[agent]** Manual M11 brand smoke for 20 visual runs, CSS palette grounding, recorded human ratings, and an 18-of-20 M3 gate. The dispatch-only workflow skips live work unless provider secrets are present.

### Changed

- **[web]** More descriptive search titles and mobile wrapping for the hero preview and skill install command.
- **[dashboard]** Production crawlers can read the existing `noindex` headers; private pages still require authentication and previews remain blocked.
- **[dashboard]** Overview is the user's completed runs. Cached sites moved to Examples (`/sites`). Agent is a URL field; setup copy appears only when keys are missing or the user has no runs yet.
- **[dashboard]** Capture failures now stop the run. Text-only is an explicit "Continue with text-only" choice, not a silent fallback.
- **[api]** HTTP API now requires a WorkOS bearer token and request-scoped BYOK headers.
- **[content]** `buildCurlExample` and `buildApiRequest` include the WorkOS bearer header and request-scoped Daytona/OpenAI keys.
- **[web]** Surfaces section heading `"Four surfaces, one agent."` → `"Five surfaces, one agent."` with revised subhead.
- **[web]** Footer GitHub link now points at [github.com/MohtashamMurshid/getdesign](https://github.com/MohtashamMurshid/getdesign) instead of the `github.com` placeholder.

### Removed

- **[repo]** Studio desktop app, Studio marketing site, release workflow, and their workspace dependencies.

## [0.0.0] — 2026-04-20

Initial scaffold per [architecture.md §12 Delivery Order](./architecture.md#12-delivery-order).

### Added

- **[repo]** Turborepo + Bun workspace with `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `apps/cli`, `apps/docs`, `packages/{agent,tools,sdk,ui,types,config}`, `convex/`, and `infra/daytona/`.
- **[web]** Next.js 16 landing page with hero, how-it-works interactive demo, surfaces grid, final CTA, and waitlist form.
- **[convex]** Initialized Convex project.
- **[docs]** [prd.md](./prd.md) (product requirements) and [architecture.md](./architecture.md) (technical architecture).
